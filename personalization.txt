CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: A
Explanation: I chose to keep it the same because it is a simple design that matches the school colors. It looks more professional as well, and I don't even have to change anything. It will also show my school spirit. I thought about choosing my own color theme, but it didn't look the best in my opinion.

NEXT QUARTER PLANNING (myclassesnextquarter.html)


My Classes for Next Quarter:
- A Block: Chorus-Mixed - 8:25 AM - 9:55 AM
- B Block: Biology - 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM
- C Block: American Sign Language I - 12:15 PM - 1:45 PM
- D Block: English/Lang Arts 9 - 1:50 PM - 3:20 PM
(Add 1st Period if applicable)


Explanation:
[Write 4-6 sentences about your next quarter schedule:
- Why did you choose these classes?
    All of these are either required or somewhat easy. I also really want to learn sign language because I know a family with deaf parents. I also like Chorus because I have that with my friend, and that class is very fun. I am pretty excited for Biology and English, because I am with my friends in those.
- What are you most looking forward to learning?
    I am most looking forward to learning in Biology. I don't know much about science, so it's good to learn. I also think that Biology is a very intersting topic. It is also somewhat important to learn about Biology.
- Which class do you think will be most challenging and why?
    I think that English will be the most challenging. I don't like wriiting long essays, and I'm overall not great at applying english terms to reading and writing. I am pretty good at writing and reading, it's just applying terms and writing about something that oesn't interest me that I'm nervous about. Reading something that isn't interesting might be hard to go along with.
- If you have a free period, how do you plan to use it productively?
    I don't have a free period.
- How will these classes help you reach your academic or career goals?]
    These classes will help me stretch my knowledge. This is good because sometimes if I'm not doing something challenging, I don't learn as much. I also think that it's good that I have a good amount of easier classes. This will keep me on track while still giving me a daily break to make sure I'm doing well.


Free Period Challenge (if applicable):
[If you have a free period, did you complete the challenge to hide it on mobile? Explain how you implemented it using d-none d-sm-block]

REFLECTION


What I Learned:
[Write 5-8 sentences reflecting on Module 1:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?
    Some bootstrap concepts that made sense to me were customization. I thought that it was cool to customize my text and overall the whole website. I like that you can make it your own easily. Another one I understood was Utility Classes like margins and text alignment. I like that one because it makes it so much easier to make your page look more put together or however you want it to look.  
- What was most challenging?
    The most challenging part was when I would see something wrong with my website, and I couldn't find what I did wrong. I would go back to check, and I couldn't find the issue. It was frustrating when I know somethings wrong but I'm lost. However, it felt very releiving once I found out how to solve my issue. I just really don't like when everything get unorganized.
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?
    My CSS customization is way better than before. I feel more confident in my work after this module. I think that it is important to be confident in your work. I feel like I can code way better on my own where I'm at right now. There are a few things that still confuse me, but only a little bit.
- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?
    In the future I would add some tips for future classes. I would also add some photos for a better look. I could also see myself adding some cuter designs if I felt like it. Other than that, though, the website is pretty good how it is. I would only make a few customization changes if I felt like it.
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?]
    I will use this site to see my future classes. Soemtimes I forget what classes I have next quarter. This website will help me prepare and get the materials I need. I can also get ready to learn the material that I am expecting for these upcoming classes. This website will help me stay organized throughout the rest of the quarter.
Hours Spent: 3 hours


EXERCISE 2: GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION


Calendar Setup:
- Did you create a new calendar or use an existing one? I created a new calendar.
- How many Canvas iCal feeds did you add? 2
- Did you add them individually by course or as one combined feed? One combined feed, because it worked when I went to Canvas.


Reflection:
[Write 4-5 sentences about the calendar integration:
- How will this calendar help you stay organized?
    This calendar will help me keep teck of when things are due. This will help me get ready for something coming up. Sometimes I forget that I have something coming up for school, so this will be very nice. I hope this keeps me more prepared and helps me organize my time.
- What challenges did you face getting it set up?
    When I was trying to make it match my website, it came out weird at first. I had to backtrack and see that I used the wrong class. I also wanted to make button to toggle between week, month, and agenda view on the calendar. Once I did it, the buttons were  on the calender, rather than above it, so I had to fix that.
- Did you customize the calendar appearance? How?
    I did, by making the colors match the rest of my website. I also added emojis for a visual view on what you were looking at. I made buttons to switch from month view, week view, and agenda view. I also changed some fonts like italisizing, so you could differntiate what information wasn't as important.
- What view works best for you (month, week, agenda)?
    The view that works best for me is week view. I like to be able to see what I have coming up, not just one day. However, I feel like sometimes a month view is too much to look at. I don't need to overwhelm myself over something that I'm not required to do until 4 weeks from now. However, it's nice to have that option there, in case I have a big project and I want to know when to start it so I can time everything out wisely.
- What other calendars might you add in the future?]
    I might add a calendar that has my stuff planned out that doesn't have to do with school. This was I can make plans with my friends and remember when they are, so I don't have to remember it at the top of my head. It's also easier to make other plans when you know what you have and when. It would feel a lot more organized knowing what plans I have, and how I can schedule everything around them.


    EXERCISE 3: DARK/LIGHT MODE TOGGLE


Color Scheme Design:
[Write 5-7 sentences about your color choices:
- What colors did you choose for light mode? Why?
    I chose different shades of pink because that is my favorite color. I really like how everything goes together in the light mode. You can see everything, and it feels like it wwakes you up. Everything is nice and clear which is good for a website. Because pink is my favorite color, I think that everything looks very good together, and I like looking at it.
- What colors did you choose for dark mode? Why?
    I chose dark blues because that is my second favorite color. All of them look really good, and you can still see everything clearly. I learned that I should put light text on a dark background for dark mode, and it looks great. The dark is also a good rest on the eyes, and I like that it automatically turns on at 7pm-7am. I really like navy blue, so this is really nice to look at.
- How do your color choices reflect your personality or style?
    I have always said the pink and navy blue were my favorite colors, so this is perfect. I also have always loved light pink more that dark pink, and dark blue more than light blue, so them being a light vs dark theme was perfect. I think that those to colors look great together in general, and they're just overall great colors. I think that this shows that pink is the sort of fun in someone, and the dark blue represents the mellow, resting part. This is nice because it shows too very different moods simply in colors that are both great.
- Did you use any color theory principles (complementary, analogous, etc.)?
    Yes, I used many Analogous colors. If I wanted a section to be fully blue, but not too much of the same color, I would just pick one close to it. I also would do this for pink, and it made every section look lie it had more dimension. Other than that, I'm not sure if I did anything else in that manor. I didn't use many opposite colors, because I wanted to keep the scheeme. The most I used opposite colors was the background to the text, because I needed to be able to see the text.
- How did you ensure good contrast for accessibility?
    Pretty much all I did to make sure you could see everything was tested things. I had the code open on one side, and the webpage on the other. I would put in a color, and if it worked, it worked. If it didn't look great, or blended into the background too much, I would test an opposite color. I would just test things until they worked, and that worked pretty well.
- What tools did you use to help choose colors?
    I used some websited that were given to me in the instructions. I used the one where I can look at good pallets. I also used one that gave you a color wheel and then gave you that chosen color's hex code. Other than that, I did most of the color choosing myself. I used the wheel that they have in the coding when you are picking a color to use, and that seemed to work pretty well.
- Were there any colors you tried that didn't work? Why not?]
    I tried to do the ocean theme that was suggested, but I didn't love it. I couldn't find a good cyan color that I liked. I also didn't like how much blue there was. It wasn't too much, and I do really like blue, but on every page seemed like a little much. I wanted something different, so I made one of the pages pink.


Theme Preferences:
- Which theme do you prefer personally and why? I prefer the pink theme because I think that it is very pretty and everything looks good together.
- When do you think dark mode is most useful? I think that dark mode is useful when you are in the dark, because then your eyes won't be so surprised by a sudden bright light, and your eyes can relax.
- Did you create any custom CSS for the toggle button? Yes, I gave it a shadow and made the button a little smaller beacause I didn't love the size.


JavaScript Understanding:
[Write 4-5 sentences showing you understand the JavaScript code:
- In your own words, what does the JavaScript do?
    The JavaScript checks on localStorage every time the page reloads. This will apply it. This way, my theme will stay with with what I change. This is good so that all of the styles stay for the themes. 
- What is localStorage and why is it useful?
    localStorage is something throughtout he whole website. It is checked on by Javascript. This happens every page load, which leads to my theme preferences staying with me. This way when we update it, it will come to be.
- What happens when you click the theme toggle button?
    When I click it, it changes to dark mode. I also addded a jaguar theme to the toggle. If I click it again, the theme is gold and black for Jefferson Academy. This is nice to have three themes, and I also like the little jaguar icon that is there when I click it.
- Why does the theme preference persist when you reload the page?
    We made it this way so that when somebody reloads for some reason, the theme doesn't change. It's just more convienient this way. If you are in the dark using dark mode, and you reload the page, it would be annoying to get exposed to so much light all of a sudden. It would also be annoying to have to switch back to the theme that you were on every time.
- How might you use JavaScript in future projects?]
    In future projects, I might use it to have toggles. If I am making a game in the future, such as tic tac toe, I will use it to let the user place their peice. It would also be nice to have this when making any other website, because there is often a usage of toggles. This weold keep everything overall better organized.
